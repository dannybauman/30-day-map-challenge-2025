## Attempts & Errors

### Attempt 1: Initial Generation
- **Status:** Initial generation
- **Result:** Got further than Day 2

### Attempt 2-N: Auto-Fix Iterations
- **User Action:** Clicked Auto Fix for errors in the code multiple times
- **Result:** Got close to showing something but still no map or data, just black
- **Final State:** Page title visible but no map or data rendered

## Data Handling Test

**Platform Approach:** Unknown (map/data never rendered)

**What Happened:**
1. Platform attempted to generate code
2. Multiple auto-fix iterations required
3. Got close to showing something
4. Final state: Just black screen, no map or data

**Data Handling Capability:** ⚠️ Could not test (map/data never rendered)

## Technical Issues

**Major Issues:**
- **No map or data:** Just black screen, no map or data rendered
- **Multiple iterations:** Required multiple Auto Fix attempts
- **Progress:** Got further than Day 2 (which was Grade F)

**Success:**
- Page loads with title "PDX Airport Noise Footprint"
- Auto-fix feature worked multiple times
- Got closer to working than Day 2

**Limitation:**
- Map/data never rendered
- Final state: Just black screen

## Human Interventions & Feedback

**User (Danny) feedback:**
- "google ai studio apps, which was another Failure"
- "it got further than day 2 but not much"
- "i did Auto Fix for errors in the code a few times"
- "it got close to showing something but still no map or data, just black"

**User Analysis:**

- Auto-fix feature worked multiple times
- Got close to showing something but map/data never rendered
- Consistent issue: Map/data rendering problems

**Comparison to Day 2:**
- **Day 2:** Grade F - Internal platform error, no code generated

## Grade Justification

**Grade D (Partial Success):**
- Page loads with title "PDX Airport Noise Footprint"
- Got further than Day 2 (which was Grade F - no code generated)
- Auto-fix feature worked multiple times
- Got close to showing something but map/data never rendered
- **Note:** User calls it a "Failure" but based on grading criteria (UI elements visible = Grade D), this is Partial Success
- **Progress:** Day 2 was Grade F (no code generated), Day 3 got further (title visible, auto-fix worked)

**Consistent with Day 1 & Day 2:**
- **Day 1:** Worked (Grade A)
- **Day 2:** Failed completely (Grade F - internal platform error, no code generated)
- **Day 3:** Partial Success (Grade D - got further than Day 2, but map/data don't render)
