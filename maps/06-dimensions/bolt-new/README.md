**Platform:** Bolt.new  
**Grade:** N/A  
**Status:** ⚠️ Not Tested (Free Tier Limit)

## Result

**Grade N/A:** Platform not tested due to free tier limit being reached. Unable to generate or test the implementation.

## Attribution

- **AI (Bolt.new)**: Not applicable - platform not tested
- **Human (Danny)**: Attempted to test platform, encountered free tier limit, assigned Grade N/A

## Issues

1. **Free tier limit:** Hit the free tier limit, preventing testing of the platform
2. **Unable to test:** Cannot generate or test the implementation due to platform limitations

## What Worked

- N/A - Platform not tested

## Human Interventions & Feedback

**User (Danny) observations:**
- "bolt.net said i hit my free limit, so let's give that a grade N/A"

**User Analysis:**
- Grade N/A is appropriate: Platform not tested due to free tier limit
- This is a platform limitation, not a failure of the implementation
- Cannot compare this platform to others for Day 6 due to access limitations

## Screenshots

- **Status:** No screenshots available - platform not tested

## Live Demo

- **Status:** Not available - platform not tested

## Notes

Bolt.new was not tested for Day 6 due to hitting the free tier limit. This is a platform access limitation rather than a failure of the implementation. Grade N/A is assigned to indicate the platform was not tested, not that it failed.
