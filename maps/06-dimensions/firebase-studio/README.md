# Day 6: Dimensions - Firebase Studio

**Platform:** Firebase Studio  
**Grade:** C+ (OK)  
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success

## Result

**Grade C+ (OK):** Had a lot of errors that required multiple fixes. Finally got a map and some of the hexes there, but many are missing, and some are maybe in the wrong location. The tooltips don't look good, and the pulsing animation isn't working. The UI of the legend is pretty good.

## Attribution

- **AI (Firebase Studio)**: Generated the 3D hexagonal visualization with height encoding total population and color encoding density. Created UI, legend, controls, and attempted to implement tooltips and pulsing animation. Required multiple iterations to fix errors.
- **Human (Danny)**: Provided implementation prompt, repeatedly told platform to fix errors, reviewed results, identified issues (missing hexes, wrong locations, tooltip problems, animation not working), assigned Grade C+ based on partial success with significant issues.

## What Worked

- ✅ **Map:** Finally got a map showing
- ✅ **Some hexes:** Some of the hexes are there
- ✅ **Legend UI:** The UI of the legend is pretty good
- ✅ **Controls:** Map controls present (zoom in/out, reset bearing, toggle sidebar)
- ✅ **Top 10 Peaks:** Highlight Top 10 Peaks control present

## Issues

1. **Multiple errors:** Had a lot of errors that required repeatedly telling the platform to fix them
2. **Missing hexes:** Many hexes are missing - not all data is displayed
3. **Wrong locations:** Some hexes are maybe in the wrong location
4. **Tooltip problems:** The tooltips don't look good
5. **Animation not working:** The pulsing animation isn't working
6. **Iteration required:** Required multiple iterations to get to a working state

## Human Interventions & Feedback

**User (Danny) actions:**
- Repeatedly told platform to fix errors
- Provided feedback on multiple iterations
- Reviewed results and identified issues

**User (Danny) observations:**
- "grade C+, it had a lot of errors i had to keep telling it to fix"
- "finally it got a map and some of the hexes there"
- "but many are missing, and some are maybe in the wrong location"
- "the tooltips don't look good"
- "the pulsing animation isn't working"
- "the UI of the legend is pretty good"

**User Analysis:**
- Grade C+ is appropriate: Usable but significant issues (missing hexes, wrong locations, tooltip problems, animation not working)
- The platform required multiple iterations to fix errors, indicating difficulty with the implementation
- Finally got a map and some hexes, showing partial success
- Missing hexes and wrong locations suggest data processing or rendering issues
- Tooltip and animation problems indicate incomplete functionality
- This aligns with the grading criteria for Grade C+ (OK) - usable but significant issues

## Notes

Firebase Studio required multiple iterations to fix errors before finally getting a map and some hexes displayed. While the legend UI is pretty good, there are significant issues: many hexes are missing, some are in wrong locations, tooltips don't look good, and the pulsing animation isn't working. Grade C+ is appropriate for a result that works but has significant issues requiring multiple iterations to achieve.
