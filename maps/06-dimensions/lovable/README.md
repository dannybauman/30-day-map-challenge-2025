# Day 6: Dimensions - Lovable

**Platform:** Lovable  
**Grade:** B (Good)  
**Status:** ✅ Success

## Result

**Grade B (Good):** One of the better results. Successfully displays all actual data as properly sized/colored hexes. Nice UI and legend. Minor issue: Top 10 Peaks button doesn't work (still shows all after clicking).

**Achieved on first try** - no iterations needed.

## Attribution

- **AI (Lovable)**: Generated the 3D hexagonal visualization with height encoding total population and color encoding population density. Created UI, legend, controls, and interactive map. Implemented zoom, pan, and hover functionality. **Achieved Grade B on first try** - no iterations needed.
- **Human (Danny)**: Provided implementation prompt, reviewed results, tested Top 10 Peaks button functionality, assigned Grade B based on strong data visualization and minor button issue.

## What Worked

- ✅ **Best data visualization:** One of the best at showing all the actual data as properly sized/colored hexes
- ✅ **No base map needed:** Doesn't show a base map, but that's fine - you can make out the map because of the hexes (not a strict requirement)
- ✅ **Nice UI:** Clean, well-designed interface
- ✅ **Nice legend:** Clear legend showing height (total population) and color (population density) scales
- ✅ **Interactive:** Zoom, pan, and hover functionality works
- ✅ **Animation:** Pause Animation button works
- ✅ **Map controls:** Zoom in/out, reset bearing to north controls present

## Issues

1. **Top 10 Peaks button:** Button is present but doesn't work - after clicking it still shows all hexes instead of filtering to top 10

## Human Interventions & Feedback

**User (Danny) observations:**
- "one of the better ones, grade B because I think it did one of the best of showing all the actual data as the properly sized/colored hexes"
- "it didn't show a base map but i think that's fine, it wasn't a strict requirement, and it's cool you can kind of make out the map because of the hexes"
- "the Top 10 Peaks button is there but doesn't work, after clicking it it still shows all"
- "nice UI and legend"

**User Analysis:**
- Grade B is appropriate: Works well, minor issue (Top 10 Peaks button), but strong data visualization
- **Achieved on first try** - demonstrates platform reliability and efficiency
- The platform successfully displayed all the actual data with proper sizing and coloring
- No base map is acceptable - the hexes themselves create a recognizable map pattern
- Minor button functionality issue doesn't detract from the overall success
- This is one of the better results for Day 6

## Notes

Lovable created one of the better visualizations for Day 6, successfully displaying all the actual data as properly sized and colored hexes. The visualization is clear and interactive, with a nice UI and legend. The only minor issue is the Top 10 Peaks button not working, but this doesn't significantly impact the overall success.
