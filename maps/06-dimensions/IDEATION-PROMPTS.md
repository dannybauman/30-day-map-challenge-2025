# Day 6: Dimensions - Ideation Prompt

**Date:** November 6, 2025
**Theme:** Dimensions (3D visualization, height encoding)

**Attribution:**
- **Human (Danny):** Set the creative direction, asked for the ideation prompt, and confirmed that all platforms must receive the exact same prompt for a fair comparison.
- **AI (Cursor):** Consolidated the workflow notes, formatted the unified prompt, and captured the documentation updates.

**Human Direction:**
- The concept must involve 3D visualization with height encoding
- Each AI should propose how to use dimensions (height, depth, elevation) in the map concept
- Keep data lightweight and ready to embed so all coding platforms can load it without external APIs
- Highlight why the concept fits the "Dimensions" theme
