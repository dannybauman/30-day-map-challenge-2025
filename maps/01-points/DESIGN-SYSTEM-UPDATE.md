# Design System Update

The Day 1 design system notes now live in the root-level `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`.  
Use that file as the single source of truth for layout, color, and responsive standards across every day.

**Why the change?**
- Keeps guidance versioned in one place
- Avoids drift between day folders and templates
- Makes future updates easier to communicate

If you need historical context for the original Day 1 overhaul, see the Git history prior to November 4, 2025 or review the references listed at the top of `DESIGN-SYSTEM.md`.
