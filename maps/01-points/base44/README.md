## The Experience

Base44 delivered the **most polished visual design** of all platforms tested. The dark theme with contrasting earthquake points is visually striking and professional.

**First Impression**: "Wow, this looks production-ready!"

The stats cards at the top (Total: 7,729, Max Mag: 7.6, Avg Depth: 0.0 km, Updated: 21:46) provide instant data overview. The legend on the right is comprehensive with 6 depth categories (< 50km, 50-100km, 100-200km, 200-300km, 300-500km, > 500km) - more granular than most platforms.

**What it used**:
- Leaflet mapping library

**Framework**: Modern responsive layout
**Hosting**: Base44 subdomain
