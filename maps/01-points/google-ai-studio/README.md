# Google AI Studio - Day 1: Points

## Result: ✅ **Success** ⭐ Surprise Performer

### Implementation Details
- **Platform**: Google AI Studio Apps (Gemini)
- **Time to Complete**: ~5 minutes
- **Iterations**: 1 (one-shot success)
- **Status**: Fully working

### Live Links
- **Live Demo**: https://ai.studio/apps/drive/18cX2TQXmcUCY8EPeOp4qAUp9Wr_W5F-a
- **Chat**: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apps/drive/18cX2TQXmcUCY8EPeOp4qAUp9Wr_W5F-a

### What Worked Well
- ⭐ **Surprise solid performer!**
- 🎯 All core features present and working
- 🎨 Clean, minimal UI design
- ⚡ Fast generation (~5 min)
- 📊 Reliable data handling
- 💪 Solid Gemini-based implementation
- ✨ Performed well

### Issues Encountered
- 🔒 Requires Google account to view (sign-in gate)
- 🎨 Less flashy than competitors (but that's not necessarily bad)
- Minimal aesthetic may not suit all projects

### Technical Notes
- Clean, functional implementation
- Good use of Gemini's capabilities
- Proper data fetching and display
- Minimal but effective UI
- Google ecosystem integration

### Rating: **B** (Good)

**Verdict**: Google AI Studio quietly delivered a solid, working implementation. While it lacks the visual pizzazz of ChatGPT Canvas or the data stats of Bolt.new, it simply works. A reliable choice that shouldn't be overlooked.

### Recommendation
**Best For**:
- Functional, minimal implementations
- Google ecosystem projects
- When you want "just works" reliability
- Internal/team tools (where sign-in is ok)

**Avoid For**:
- Public sharing (requires Google account)
- When you need flashy visuals
- Maximum aesthetic appeal

### Surprise Factor
Google AI Studio flew under the radar but delivered. While Gemini Artifacts (the chat version) struggled with the same issues as Claude, the dedicated AI Studio Apps platform worked well. Don't sleep on this option!
