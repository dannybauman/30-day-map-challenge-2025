# Claude Artifacts - Day 29: Raster

**Grade:** C-
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success
**URL:** https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/c078fc96-391d-4e79-a900-8a566c62a097

## Overview

After some errors, and issues with the rain raster properly staying in the right location on the map when panning/zooming (almost all platforms had this issue at first, most could be corrected with a follow up prompt), it shows ink blots but not the real rain or map.

## Results

Ink blot visualization works but real rain data and map not displaying correctly.

## Issues

- Initial errors
- Pan/zoom raster positioning issues
- Real rain data not showing
- Map not displaying correctly

## Why Grade C-

- Ink blots rendering
- Real rain/map not working
- Partial success

## Observations

Consistent with previous days - Claude Artifacts often has issues with external APIs and data rendering. Ink blot visualization works but core functionality (rain data, map) not working.
