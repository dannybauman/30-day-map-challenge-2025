## Overview

Nice UI but after multiple tries still couldn't get the map or data showing.

## Results

UI generated correctly with controls and styling, but map and radar data not rendering.

## Issues

- Map not showing
- Radar data not loading
- Multiple attempts didn't resolve

## Why Grade C-

- UI works well
- Map/data rendering issues persisted
- Partial success (UI generated)

## Observations

Consistent with previous days - ChatGPT Canvas sometimes has map rendering issues. UI generation is strong but data/map rendering can be problematic.
