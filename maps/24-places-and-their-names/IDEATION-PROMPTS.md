UNIFIED IDEATION PROMPT — Day 24: Places and their names

Today's #30DayMapChallenge theme is: Places and their names
Theme description: Toponymy—font choices, label placement, typography, languages, name meanings.

Please give me 2 map concepts for this theme:
- 1 creative/unusual approach
- 1 straightforward/classic approach

For each concept, include:
1) What the map shows (1-2 sentences)
2) Data source needed
3) Difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
4) Estimated implementation time
5) One unique aspect that makes it interesting
6) Optional: one image-generation idea (what to render, style, and how it pairs with the map) that could be automated—no manual drawing.

Consider:
- Buildable in ~1 hour across multiple AI platforms
- Visual appeal and shareability
- Data availability (prefer free, accessible sources)
- Technical feasibility for web-based visualization
- Creativity within constraints
- Should work well as web-based interactive map
- Can be implemented by AI coding platforms
- Image generation is allowed if it’s automatable via AI (no manual art)

Format as a numbered list.
```
