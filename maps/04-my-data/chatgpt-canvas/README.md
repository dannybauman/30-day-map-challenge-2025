# ChatGPT Canvas - Day 4: My Data

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success (Grade D)
**Time:** ~15 minutes
**Shared URL:** https://chatgpt.com/canvas/shared/690bc8d900048191b01db468789b6c49

## Result

Couldn't load data all the way. Loaded data inline but couldn't show it on the map. Tried auto-fix errors a few times, didn't work.

## Notes

- **Data loading:** Attempted to load GeoJSON inline in JavaScript
- **Issue:** Data was processed but couldn't be displayed on the map
- **Auto-fix attempts:** Multiple attempts to fix errors, none successful
- **Pattern:** Similar to Day 2 - data processing issues with large inline GeoJSON

## Grade: D (Partial Success)

UI generated but data visualization failed. Grade D because it generated something useful (code structure) even though map rendering didn't work.
