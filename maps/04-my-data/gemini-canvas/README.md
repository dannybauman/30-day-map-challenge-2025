# Gemini Canvas - Day 4: My Data

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success (Grade D)
**Time:** ~15 minutes
**Shared URL:** https://gemini.google.com/share/47b10c6d5a96

## Result

Showed a bit of UI but not much else. Couldn't load data or map. Tried auto-fix errors a few times, didn't work.

## Notes

- **UI generation:** Generated some UI elements
- **Data loading:** Failed to load GeoJSON data
- **Map rendering:** Map didn't render
- **Auto-fix attempts:** Multiple attempts to fix errors, none successful
- **Pattern:** Similar to Day 2 - UI works but map/data rendering fails

## Grade: D (Partial Success)

UI generated but data loading and map rendering failed. Grade D because it generated something useful (UI structure) even though map rendering didn't work.
