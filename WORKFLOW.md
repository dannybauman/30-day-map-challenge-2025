# Day-by-Day Workflow

This document tracks the actual workflow for each day of the challenge.

---

## The Process

### Phase 1: Ideation (Web LLMs)
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

1. Get ideation prompts from Cursor
2. Paste into web versions:
   - Claude.ai (Sonnet 4.5)
   - ChatGPT (GPT-4o)
   - Gemini (2.5 Pro)
3. Review 6 ideas (2 from each)
4. Pick the best idea
5. Paste chosen concept back into Cursor

### Phase 2: Implementation Prep (Cursor)
**Duration**: 5 minutes

1. Cursor helps craft the implementation prompt
2. Customize for the chosen concept
3. Copy final prompt to clipboard

### Phase 3: Multi-Platform Launch
**Duration**: 5-10 minutes

1. Open 8-10 platform tabs
2. Paste same prompt into each
3. Hit generate on all
4. Let them cook!

### Phase 4: Review & Iterate
**Duration**: 30 minutes

1. Check results every 5-10 minutes
2. Iterate on 2-3 most promising
3. Screenshot everything as you go

### Phase 5: Documentation
**Duration**: 10-15 minutes

1. Save code to platform folders
2. Save screenshots
3. Update DAILY-LOG.md
4. Update PLATFORM-TRACKER.md
5. Git commit

## Day 1: Points

**Theme**: Point data (locations, POIs, clusters). Focus on symbolization and density.

**Status**: 🚧 Ready for ideation

### Step 1: Get Ideation Prompts ✅

Use the prompts below on each website:

---

#### For Claude.ai

```
Today's #30DayMapChallenge theme is: POINTS

Theme description: Point data (locations, POIs, clusters). Focus on symbolization and density visualization.

Give me 2 map concepts for this theme - one creative/unusual and one straightforward/classic.

For each concept, provide:
1. Title and 2-sentence description
2. Specific data source (must be free/accessible)
3. Estimated implementation difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
4. Why it would work well across multiple AI development platforms
5. Visual appeal for social media sharing

Constraints:
- Must be achievable in ~1 hour
- Should work as web-based interactive map
- Data must be free and readily available
- Will be implemented using platforms like Claude Artifacts, Bolt.new, V0.dev, etc.
- Goal is to test which platforms handle point visualization best

Please be specific about data sources and keep concepts realistic for rapid implementation.

#### For ChatGPT (GPT-4o)

```
I'm doing the #30DayMapChallenge. Today's theme is: POINTS

Description: Point data (locations, POIs, clusters). Focus on symbolization and density.

Give me 2 map concepts:
- 1 creative/unexpected interpretation
- 1 straightforward/classic approach

For each, specify:
1. Clear concept description (2-3 sentences)
2. Exact data source (with URL if possible)
3. Difficulty level and estimated time
4. Why it's good for testing AI development platforms
5. What makes it visually compelling

Requirements:
- Implementable in 1 hour across multiple platforms
- Free, accessible data
- Web-based interactive visualization
- Should work on platforms like Replit, Lovable, ChatGPT Canvas, etc.
- Test case for comparing AI coding tools

Be specific about data access and implementation approach.
```

#### For Gemini (2.5 Pro)

```
#30DayMapChallenge Theme: POINTS

Focus: Point data - locations, POIs, clusters. Emphasize symbolization and density visualization.

Please provide 2 map concepts:
1. One creative/artistic interpretation
2. One practical/straightforward approach

For each concept include:
- Title and description (2-3 sentences)
- Data source (must be free and accessible)
- Implementation complexity (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Why it tests AI platform capabilities well
- Visual/shareability factor

Context:
- I'll implement this across 8-10 AI development platforms (Claude Artifacts, Bolt.new, V0.dev, Google AI Studio, Replit, etc.)
- Goal is comparative analysis: which platforms handle cartography best
- Need concepts that work in ~1 hour
- Should be web-based, interactive
- Will be shared on social media

Focus on feasible, well-defined concepts with clear data sources.
