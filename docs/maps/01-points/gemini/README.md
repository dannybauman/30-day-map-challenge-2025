# Gemini (Artifacts) - Day 1: Points

## Result: ⚠️ **Partial Success**

### Implementation Details
- **Platform**: Gemini Pro 2.5 (Artifacts)
- **Time to Complete**: ~15 minutes
- **Iterations**: Multiple debugging attempts
- **Status**: UI renders but data loading issues

### Live Links
- **Artifact**: https://gemini.google.com/share/ca0176434f8c
- **Chat**: https://gemini.google.com/app/2621559dccdaf201

### What Worked Well
- 🎨 Good UI structure
- ⚡ Fast initial generation
- 📝 Clean code organization
- 🎯 Understood requirements

### Issues Encountered
- ❌ **Similar issues to Claude Artifacts**
- ❌ External API data loading problems
- 🔒 Requires sign-in to view shared artifacts
- ⚠️ Multiple iterations needed
- 📉 Sandbox restrictions similar to Claude

### Technical Notes
- Gemini chat model is good for ideation
- But Gemini Artifacts has similar sandbox limitations as Claude
- External API calls problematic
- Would need embedded data approach
- Requires Google account to view shares

### Interesting Contrast
**Gemini Artifacts** (chat-based artifacts) struggled with the same issues as Claude Artifacts, but **Google AI Studio Apps** (dedicated app builder) worked well with identical prompt. This shows the platform matters more than the underlying model.

### Rating: **D** (Below Average)

**Verdict**: Gemini Artifacts shares the same fundamental limitations as Claude Artifacts - restrictive sandboxes that break external API integrations. However, Google AI Studio Apps (using the same Gemini model) succeeded where Artifacts failed.

### Recommendation
**Best For**:
- Google ecosystem work
- Embedded data visualizations
- When you can bundle dependencies

**Avoid For**:
- External API integrations
- Public sharing (requires sign-in)
- Complex web applications

**Better Alternative**: Use Google AI Studio Apps instead of Gemini Artifacts for web apps!

### Key Insight
The lesson: **Same AI model, different platform = different results**. Gemini Pro 2.5 powers both Gemini Artifacts (partial success) and Google AI Studio Apps (full success). The infrastructure and sandbox matter more than the model itself.
