# Day 6: Dimensions - Google Gemini Canvas

**Platform:** Google Gemini Canvas  
**Grade:** D (Partial Success)  
**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success

## Result

**Grade D (Partial Success):** Platform generated partial success, but the entire chat thread disappeared when reloaded, making it inaccessible. Unable to retrieve or verify the result.

## Attribution

- **AI (Google Gemini Canvas)**: Generated code and UI for the 3D population peaks visualization. Achieved partial success before the chat thread was lost.
- **Human (Danny)**: Provided implementation prompt, observed partial success, attempted to reload/verify result, discovered chat thread had disappeared, assigned Grade D based on partial success that was lost.

## Issues

1. **Chat thread loss:** Entire chat thread disappeared when reloaded, making the result inaccessible
2. **Unable to verify:** Cannot confirm what worked or what didn't work due to lost chat thread
3. **Platform reliability:** Chat thread persistence issue prevented verification and documentation

## What Worked (Before Thread Loss)

- Platform generated partial success (details unknown due to thread loss)
- UI and code were generated (specifics unknown)

## Human Interventions & Feedback

**User (Danny) observations:**
- Observed partial success during initial generation
- Attempted to reload/verify the result
- Discovered the entire chat thread had disappeared
- Decided not to retry (would be unfair comparison)
- Assigned Grade D (Partial Success) based on observed partial success before thread loss

**User Analysis:**
- Grade D is appropriate: Platform generated something (partial success) but result is inaccessible
- Chat thread persistence issue is a platform reliability problem
- This aligns with the grading criteria for Partial Success (Grade D) - something was generated but major functionality (accessibility/persistence) is broken
- Decision not to retry: Would be unfair to other platforms to give Gemini Canvas a second attempt

## Screenshots

- **Status:** No screenshots available - chat thread disappeared before screenshots could be captured

## Live Demo

- **Status:** Not available - chat thread disappeared, unable to retrieve link

## Notes

The platform generated partial success, but the entire chat thread disappeared when reloaded. This is a platform reliability issue that prevented verification and documentation of the result. Grade D (Partial Success) is assigned based on the observed partial success before the thread was lost, but specific details of what worked or didn't work are unknown.
