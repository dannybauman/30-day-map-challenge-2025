# Day 6: Dimensions - Google AI Studio

**Platform:** Google AI Studio  
**Grade:** F (Failed)  
**Status:** ❌ Failed

## Result

**Grade F (Failed):** Platform failed again. Couldn't get to the point of displaying anything. No code/output generated that was usable.

## Attribution

- **AI (Google AI Studio)**: Attempted to generate the 3D population peaks visualization but failed to produce usable output.
- **Human (Danny)**: Provided implementation prompt, attempted to test platform, identified failure (couldn't get to displaying anything), assigned Grade F based on complete failure.

## Issues

1. **Complete failure:** Couldn't get to the point of displaying anything
2. **No usable output:** No code/output generated that was usable
3. **Consistent failure pattern:** This is a consistent failure pattern for Google AI Studio (also failed on previous days)

## What Worked

- N/A - Platform failed completely

## Human Interventions & Feedback

**User (Danny) observations:**
- "google ai studio also failed again, couldn't get to the point of displaying anything, grade F"

**User Analysis:**
- Grade F is appropriate: No code/output generated at all (platform infrastructure failure)
- This is a consistent failure pattern for Google AI Studio across multiple days
- The platform couldn't get to the point of displaying anything, indicating a complete failure
- This aligns with the grading criteria for Grade F (Failed) - no code/output generated at all

## Screenshots

- **Status:** No screenshots available - platform failed completely

## Live Demo

- **Status:** Not available - platform failed completely

## Notes

Google AI Studio failed again for Day 6, consistent with previous days. The platform couldn't get to the point of displaying anything, indicating a complete failure. Grade F is assigned because no code/output was generated at all, which is the distinction for Grade F (platform infrastructure failures) versus Grade D (partial success where some elements work).
