# Day 26: Transport — Ideation Prompt

Used identically across ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini.

```
Today's #30DayMapChallenge theme: Transport (mobility, traffic flow, transit networks, logistics, sustainable transport).

Give me 2 map concepts for this theme:
- 1 creative/unusual approach
- 1 straightforward/classic approach

For each concept, include:
1) What the map shows (1-2 sentences)
2) Data source needed (public/free; prefer OSM/Overture/GTFS/static CSV/GeoJSON; avoid proprietary API keys)
3) Difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
4) Estimated implementation time (~1 hour target)
5) One unique aspect that makes it interesting or shareable
6) Why it fits a quick web-based interactive map that AI coding platforms can build without manual data creation or hand-drawn inputs

Constraints:
- Must be feasible with automated data retrieval or small embedded samples (no manual digitizing)
- Should work with plain web tech (JS/HTML/CSS) and be testable without secret keys
- Keep it responsive and visually clear on desktop and mobile

Format as a numbered list.
