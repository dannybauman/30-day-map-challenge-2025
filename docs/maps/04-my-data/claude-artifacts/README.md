# Claude Artifacts - Day 4: My Data

**Status:** ⚠️ Partial Success (Grade D)
**Time:** ~15 minutes
**Shared URL:** https://claude.ai/public/artifacts/cfa10548-8b32-4a19-a33c-4286c29c78b1

## Result

Couldn't load data fully. Kept stopping output and asking if I wanted to continue (was putting GeoJSON inline). Tried auto-fix errors a few times, didn't work.

## Notes

- **Data loading:** Attempted to embed GeoJSON inline in JavaScript
- **Issue:** Output kept stopping due to large inline data, required manual continuation prompts
- **Auto-fix attempts:** Multiple attempts to fix errors, none successful
- **Pattern:** Same CSP/CORS pattern as Days 1-3, but also had output interruption issues with large inline data

## Grade: D (Partial Success)

UI/legend generated but data loading and map rendering failed. Grade D because it generated something useful (code structure) even though it couldn't complete due to inline data size limitations.
