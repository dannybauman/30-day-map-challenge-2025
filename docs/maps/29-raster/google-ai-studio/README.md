# Google AI Studio - Day 29: Raster

**Grade:** B+
**Status:** ✅ Success
**URL:** https://rorschach-rain-903076358991.us-west1.run.app/

## Overview

Had a few errors and issues but got to a nice working spot. The local object detection algorithm it chose is kind of cool looking.

## Results

Worked through initial errors to reach a functional state. The local object detection implementation has an interesting visual style.

## Why Grade B+

- Had some errors initially but resolved them
- Reached a working state
- Local object detection algorithm has cool visual style
- Good iteration process

## Observations

Consistent with previous days - Google AI Studio (with Gemini 3) works well but may need some iteration to resolve errors. The local object detection algorithm it implemented has a distinctive visual style that's interesting.
