## Overview

Almost worked the first try. Small issue was the color scheme making it hard to see the dark rain on the map. Also had issues with locking in the location of the rain on the map during pan/zoom, but fixed with a prompt.

## Results

Correctly implemented the animation timeline playback. Choppy playback at first, but improved with a prompt.

## Issues Fixed

- Color scheme visibility (dark rain on dark map) - fixed with prompt
- Pan/zoom raster locking issues - fixed with prompt
- Animation playback choppiness - improved with prompt

## Why Grade B+

## Observations

Strong first attempt. Most issues were fixable with follow-up prompts, showing good responsiveness to feedback.
