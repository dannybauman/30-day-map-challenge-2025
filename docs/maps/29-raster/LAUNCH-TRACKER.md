## Human Guidance vs AI Contributions

### User Guidance (Human Contributions):
- Tried multiple platforms initially
- Once AntiGravity showed promise, focused development time there
- Added features: local + cloud detection, area selection, UI improvements
- Fixed pan/zoom issues with follow-up prompts (most platforms)
- Fixed color scheme visibility issues
- Improved animation playback smoothness

### AI Contributions:
- Generated initial implementations across platforms
- Fixed pan/zoom raster locking issues when prompted
- Improved color schemes for visibility
- Enhanced animation playback smoothness
- Implemented local object detection algorithm
- Integrated Gemini Vision API for cloud detection

## Notes & Observations

**Common Issues:**
- Pan/zoom issues with rain raster staying locked to map (most platforms initially)
- Color scheme visibility (dark rain on dark map)
- Animation playback choppiness
- Most issues fixed with follow-up prompts

**Platform Strengths:**
- **AntiGravity**: Good for larger projects, browser control, downloadable IDE
- **Gemini Canvas**: Almost worked first try, good iteration
- **v0**: Now using Opus 4.5, improved results

**Platform Weaknesses:**
- **ChatGPT Canvas**: Map/data rendering issues persisted
- **Claude Artifact**: Raster positioning problems
- **Base44**: Error handling issues, got stuck in error

**Surprising Results:**
- **AntiGravity discovery**: New tool worked well, similar to Gemini 3 + AI Studio but better for larger projects
- **v0 improvement**: Opus 4.5 upgrade seems to help
- **Gemini Canvas**: Strong first attempt

**New Tool: Google AntiGravity**
- Google's new AI-powered IDE (similar to Cursor)
- Made by Windsurf team (almost acquired by OpenAI but not quite, then hired by Google instead)
- Downloadable Mac app, works outside browser
- Good for larger projects with more control
- Automated browser control for debugging/testing
- Similar results to Gemini 3 + Google AI Studio
- Spent most development time here adding features
- **Deployment:** Doesn't have simple one-click deploy, so set up GitHub repo and deployed to GitHub Pages. AI made the setup easy.
