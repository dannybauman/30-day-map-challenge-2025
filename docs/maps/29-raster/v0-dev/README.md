# v0.dev - Day 29: Raster

**Grade:** B
**Status:** ✅ Success
**URL:** https://v0-rorschach-rain-map.vercel.app/

## Overview

Had an error at first and pan/zoom issues and choppy animation of the rain, but otherwise working well. The inkblot version of the visual seems to be a bit funky and off but probably easy to improve with more prompting.

## Results

v0 is now using Opus 4.5 so hopefully that caused this to work pretty well.

## Issues

- Initial error (resolved)
- Pan/zoom issues with rain raster
- Choppy animation playback
- Inkblot visualization needs improvement

## Why Grade B

- Working implementation
- Pan/zoom and animation issues
- Inkblot needs polish
- Opus 4.5 upgrade seems to help

## Observations

v0 improvement with Opus 4.5 upgrade. Working implementation but needs polish on inkblot visualization.
