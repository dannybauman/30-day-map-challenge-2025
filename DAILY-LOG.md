Quick tracker for daily progress. One line per day with key stats.

## November 2025

| Day | Date | Theme | Status | Platforms Attempted | Successful | Time | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|--------|---------------------|------------|------|-------|
| 1 | Nov 1 | Points | ✅ | 11 | 8 | ~1.5 hrs | Earthquake map. Top 3: ChatGPT, Bolt, Lovable. Base44 best stats. Human check: approved fetch prompt, captured screenshots, logged mobile/legend issues. |
| 2 | Nov 2 | Lines | ⏳ | - | - | - | |
| 3 | Nov 3 | Polygons | ✅ | 10 | 4 (4 full, 6 partial) | ~150 min | Airport Noise Footprint (PDX). Complete! MagicPatterns: Grade B (First full success! Works well with mock data). Bolt.new: Grade B (Second full success! Works well with mock data, minor legend text wrapping issue). Firebase Studio: Grade B (Third full success! **FIRST PLATFORM TO USE REAL DATA!** Minor UX issues but major achievement). Base44: Grade B (Fourth full success! Works well with mock data, minor airport icon image issue). Claude Artifacts: Grade D (CSP/CORS, same as Day 1/2). ChatGPT Canvas: Grade C/C+ (mock data, multiple fixes needed). Gemini Canvas: Grade D (UI OK, map/data rendering failed, regression after fixes). Lovable: Grade D (Mapbox API key requirement blocked testing). V0.dev: Grade D (Base map doesn't render, consistent with Day 1 & Day 2). Google AI Studio Apps: Grade D (Page title visible but map/data don't render, improved from Day 2's Grade F). Key learning: Avoid Mapbox in future prompts. Firebase Studio successfully used real data (first platform to do so)! |
| 4 | Nov 4 | My Data | ✅ | 9 | 2 (2 full, 6 partial, 1 failed) | ~80 min | Disney Park GPS waypoints (118 points). Dataset prep complete: extracted GPS waypoints from Google Timeline, updated from aggregated visits to individual waypoints. Lovable: Grade B (first attempt success! Map renders correctly, stats work, good UI. Minor: UI takes up a lot of page space). Base44: Grade B (maybe one of the best! Nice visuals, clustering AND heatmap option). Bolt.new: Grade B- (worked great in dev but deployed with data loading error). MagicPatterns: Grade B- (works mostly, only shows 5 points instead of 118). Firebase Studio: Grade C- (multiple JSON errors, data doesn't load correctly). ChatGPT Canvas: Grade D (loaded data inline but couldn't show on map). Claude Artifacts: Grade D (kept stopping output with inline GeoJSON, couldn't complete). Gemini Canvas: Grade D (showed UI but couldn't load data or map). Google AI Studio: Grade F (errors prevented getting to a map). Platform file format discovery: Lovable supports .geojson directly, Bolt.new & Google AI Studio require .txt, Base44/Firebase/MagicPatterns have different upload workflows. Inline data issues: ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini all struggled with large inline GeoJSON. Human check: verified script extracts GPS waypoints correctly, captured desktop + mobile screenshots (including scrolled map views), documented file upload limitations. Timeline note: Phase 7 wrapped on Nov 5 after the dataset sanitization + per-platform documentation push captured in maps/04-my-data/README.md and LAUNCH-TRACKER.md. |
