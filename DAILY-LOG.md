Bolt.new: Grade B (Second full success! Works well with mock data, minor legend text wrapping issue). Firebase Studio: Grade B (Third full success! **FIRST PLATFORM TO USE REAL DATA!** Minor UX issues but major achievement). Claude Artifacts: Grade D (CSP/CORS, same as Day 1/2). ChatGPT Canvas: Grade C/C+ (mock data, multiple fixes needed). Gemini Canvas: Grade D (UI OK, map/data rendering failed, regression after fixes). Lovable: Grade D (Mapbox API key requirement blocked testing). V0.dev: Grade D (Base map doesn't render, consistent with Day 1 & Day 2).
