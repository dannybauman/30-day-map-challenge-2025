# Daily Log - 30 Day Map Challenge 2025

Quick tracker for daily progress. One line per day with key stats.

## November 2025

| Day | Date | Theme | Status | Platforms Attempted | Successful | Time | Notes |
|-----|------|-------|--------|---------------------|------------|------|-------|
| 1 | Nov 1 | Points | ✅ | 11 | 8 | ~1.5 hrs | Earthquake map. Top 3: ChatGPT, Bolt, Lovable. Base44 best stats. Human check: approved fetch prompt, captured screenshots, logged mobile/legend issues. |
| 2 | Nov 2 | Lines | ⏳ | - | - | - | |
| 3 | Nov 3 | Polygons | ✅ | 10 | 4 (4 full, 6 partial) | ~150 min | Airport Noise Footprint (PDX). Complete! MagicPatterns: Grade B (First full success! Works well with mock data). Bolt.new: Grade B (Second full success! Works well with mock data, minor legend text wrapping issue). Firebase Studio: Grade B (Third full success! **FIRST PLATFORM TO USE REAL DATA!** Minor UX issues but major achievement). Base44: Grade B (Fourth full success! Works well with mock data, minor airport icon image issue). Claude Artifacts: Grade D (CSP/CORS, same as Day 1/2). ChatGPT Canvas: Grade C/C+ (mock data, multiple fixes needed). Gemini Canvas: Grade D (UI OK, map/data rendering failed, regression after fixes). Lovable: Grade D (Mapbox API key requirement blocked testing). V0.dev: Grade D (Base map doesn't render, consistent with Day 1 & Day 2). Google AI Studio Apps: Grade D (Page title visible but map/data don't render, improved from Day 2's Grade F). Key learning: Avoid Mapbox in future prompts. Firebase Studio successfully used real data (first platform to do so)! |
| 4 | Nov 4 | My Data | ✅ | 9 | 2 (2 full, 6 partial, 1 failed) | ~80 min | Disney Park GPS waypoints (118 points). Dataset prep complete: extracted GPS waypoints from Google Timeline, updated from aggregated visits to individual waypoints. Lovable: Grade B (first attempt success! Map renders correctly, stats work, good UI. Minor: UI takes up a lot of page space). Base44: Grade B (maybe one of the best! Nice visuals, clustering AND heatmap option). Bolt.new: Grade B- (worked great in dev but deployed with data loading error). MagicPatterns: Grade B- (works mostly, only shows 5 points instead of 118). Firebase Studio: Grade C- (multiple JSON errors, data doesn't load correctly). ChatGPT Canvas: Grade D (loaded data inline but couldn't show on map). Claude Artifacts: Grade D (kept stopping output with inline GeoJSON, couldn't complete). Gemini Canvas: Grade D (showed UI but couldn't load data or map). Google AI Studio: Grade F (errors prevented getting to a map). Platform file format discovery: Lovable supports .geojson directly, Bolt.new & Google AI Studio require .txt, Base44/Firebase/MagicPatterns have different upload workflows. Inline data issues: ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini all struggled with large inline GeoJSON. Human check: verified script extracts GPS waypoints correctly, captured desktop + mobile screenshots (including scrolled map views), documented file upload limitations. Timeline note: Phase 7 wrapped on Nov 5 after the dataset sanitization + per-platform documentation push captured in maps/04-my-data/README.md and LAUNCH-TRACKER.md. |
| 5 | Nov 5 | Earth | ⏳ | - | - | - | |
| 6 | Nov 6 | Dimensions | ✅ | 10 | 2 (2 full, 6 partial, 1 failed, 1 N/A) | ~2 hrs | 3D Population Peaks Hex Map. Lovable: Grade B (first try success! One of the better results - displays all actual data as properly sized/colored hexes. Minor: Top 10 Peaks button doesn't work). Base44: Grade B (base map and hexes in right places. Minor: missing some hexes, single color, height chart issue). MagicPatterns: Grade B- (strong initial progress but ran out of free credits). Firebase Studio: Grade C+ (multiple errors, finally got map and some hexes, many missing/wrong locations). V0.dev: Grade C (kinda worked but can't pan, limited data visibility). ChatGPT Canvas: Grade D (UI works but map doesn't render, GeoJSON handling issues). Claude Artifacts: Grade D (UI works but map doesn't render, library error, had to click continue). Gemini Canvas: Grade D (partial success but chat thread disappeared). Google AI Studio: Grade F (failed again, couldn't get to displaying anything). Bolt.new: Grade N/A (free tier limit). Key learning: Large GeoJSON files continue to challenge platforms. Free tier limits becoming a factor. Pan functionality important for 3D visualizations. |

| 18 | Nov 18 | Out of this world → Gemini 3 Testing | ✅ | 1 (Gemini 3 Pro) | 2 full, 2 partial | ~3 hrs | Repurposed to test Gemini 3 Pro breakthrough. Created 4 maps (SeismicWatch: Grade A, Climate Migration: Grade B+, Global Connections: Grade D deployment, Cosmic Sightings: Grade D deployment). Platform discovery: Gemini 3 is a step-change improvement over Gemini 2.5 (Grade F → Grade A capable). 50% deployment success rate (module loading issues), but preview quality is 100%. Gemini 3 + AI Studio elevated to Tier 1 for Days 19-30. Human: Recognized platform breakthrough, selected 4 test concepts, guided 2-3 prompt iterations per successful app, attempted deployment debugging. |
| 19 | Nov 19 | Projections (GIS Day) | ✅ | 1 (Gemini 3 Pro × 2) | 2 full | ~3-4 hrs | Dual-concept day: Shape Shifter (morphing projections) + Tissot's Lie Detector (distortion comparison). Both Grade A+, working in 3 prompts, polished in ~10 more. Gemini 3 continues to dominate with technical accuracy, animation mastery, and design quality. Strategy shift: dual-concept with best platform > single-concept across weak platforms. |

Partial: Claude Artifact (C), base44 (C-), ChatGPT Canvas (D). Human check: requested GTFS uploads, smooth animations, data caching, fixed color gaps. |
