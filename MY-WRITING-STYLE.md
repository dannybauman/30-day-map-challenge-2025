# My Writing Style

## Summary

Guidelines for writing natural, professional documentation that avoids overly excited AI-sounding language and aggressive phrasing.

## ✅ Words to Use

- "good", "strong", "solid"
- "clean", "well-designed"
- "worked", "performed well"
- "interesting", "notable"
- Matter-of-fact descriptions
- "prompt" instead of "brief"

## ❌ Words to Avoid

- "excellent" (overused)
- "gorgeous", "beautiful" (too subjective/dramatic)
- "killer feature" (cringey tech bro speak)
- "brilliantly", "perfectly" (trying too hard)
- "perfect" / "perfectly" (NEVER - nothing is perfect, don't exaggerate or try to live up to this)
- "exceeded expectations" (AI-sounding)
- "breakthrough" (too grandiose)
- "brief" (use "prompt" instead - sounds more natural)
- "administrative" (too jargon-y - use "basic", "conventional", "rectangular shapes", "state outlines" instead)
- "halted" (too formal - use "stopped" instead)
- "pursuing" (too formal - use "trying" instead)
- "demanded", "insisted", "forced" (too aggressive - use "asked for", "requested", "required" instead)
- Multiple exclamation marks (!!)
- Excessive parenthetical asides
- ALL CAPS (be careful - use sparingly, only for emphasis when needed)
- "novel" (sounds hype-y; use "interesting", "useful", or "creative")
- "drove" (use "guided", "led", or "directed" instead)
- "nailed" (too confident; use "did well", "performed well", "worked well", or "got it right" instead)
- "matured" (too formal/hype-y; use "got better", "improved", or "were designed better" instead)
- "shipped" (too techie; use "released", "created", "built", or "completed" instead)
- "gating" (too techie/jargon-y; use "blocking", "limiting", or "restricting" instead)
- "explicitly" (too formal; use "directly", "clearly", or just remove if not needed)

## Punctuation Guidelines

- **Don't use em dashes (—)** - use regular dashes (-) or colons (:) instead
- **Don't use multiple exclamation marks** - use single periods
- **Avoid excessive parentheses** - keep asides minimal

## Style Guidelines

1. **Be direct**: Say what happened, not how amazing it was
2. **Use specific details**: "Shows 7,734 earthquakes" beats "amazing data display"
3. **Avoid hyperbole**: If everything is excellent, nothing is
4. **Sound human**: Write like you're telling a colleague, not marketing
5. **One adjective max**: "clean dark theme" not "gorgeous top-tier stunning dark theme"
6. **Never say perfect**: Nothing is perfect. Use "worked well", "accurate", "clean execution" instead. Don't exaggerate or try to live up to perfection.
7. **Avoid grandiose words**: "breakthrough" → "insight", "key finding", "what worked"
8. **Use all caps sparingly**: Only when truly needed for emphasis, not for regular text
9. **Use "prompt" not "brief"**: "rewrote the prompt" not "rewrote the brief"
10. **Avoid em dashes**: Use regular dashes (-) or colons (:) instead of em dashes (—)
11. **Avoid aggressive language**: Use "asked for" or "requested" instead of "demanded" or "insisted". Use "required" instead of "forced" when describing what happened.
12. **Avoid jargon**: Use plain language instead of technical terms. "Administrative boundaries" → "boring rectangular shapes" or "state outlines". Describe what things actually are, not their technical category.

## Examples

**Before**: "Bolt.new delivered an excellent implementation with gorgeous visuals and killer features!"
**After**: "Bolt.new shows 7,734 earthquakes with detailed stats (max mag 7.6, avg depth 21km). Strong tooltips."

**Before**: "Round 1 was a miss—every model handed me administrative boundaries—so I halted the run, rewrote the brief..."
**After**: "Round 1 was a miss: every model handed me administrative boundaries, so I halted the run, rewrote the prompt..."

**Before**: "Where I Redirected The Brief"
**After**: "Where I Redirected The Prompt"

**Before**: "Called out the first batch for being too administrative and demanded organic shapes."
**After**: "Called out the first batch for being too administrative and asked for organic shapes."

**Before**: "Rewrote the prompt to insist on organic shapes."
**After**: "Rewrote the prompt to ask for organic shapes."

**Before**: "The concept forced every platform to grapple with real GIS workflows."
**After**: "The concept required every platform to grapple with real GIS workflows."

**Before**: "Round 1 was a miss: every model handed me administrative boundaries."
**After**: "Round 1 was a miss: every model gave me basic shapes like state outlines."

**Before**: "Nailed the 'small dataset, high impact' prompt and pointed straight to the FAA/BTAA sources."
**After**: "Did well with the 'small dataset, high impact' prompt and pointed straight to the FAA/BTAA sources."

## Why This Matters

AI-generated text often sounds overly enthusiastic and unnatural, using the same excited words repeatedly. This makes documentation less credible and harder to trust.

Use varied, specific language that focuses on what actually happened rather than how you felt about it. Let the results speak for themselves.
