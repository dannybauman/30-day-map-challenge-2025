# My Writing Style

## Summary

Guidelines for writing simple, direct documentation that sounds like a real person talking to a colleague. Cut unnecessary words, use simpler verbs, and drop formal phrasing.

## Core Principle: Be Direct and Concise

Write like you're explaining what happened to someone sitting next to you. Shorter is better. Drop unnecessary verbs and formal words.

**Key pattern**: "tried X, hit Y, Grade Z" not "attempted to X, encountered Y, assigned Grade Z"

## ✅ Words to Use

- "good", "strong", "solid"
- "clean", "well-designed"
- "worked", "performed well"
- "interesting", "notable"
- Matter-of-fact descriptions
- "prompt" instead of "brief"
- "tried" instead of "attempted"
- "hit" instead of "encountered"
- "stopped" instead of "halted"
- Simple, direct verbs: "did", "got", "made", "ran"

## ❌ Words to Avoid

### Overly Formal Verbs
- "attempted" (use "tried" instead)
- "encountered" (use "hit", "ran into", or "found" instead)
- "assigned" (when describing grades - just say "Grade B-" not "assigned Grade B-")
- "halted" (use "stopped" instead)
- "pursuing" (use "trying" instead)
- "explicitly" (use "directly", "clearly", or just remove)

### Hype-y or Overused
- "excellent" (overused)
- "gorgeous", "beautiful" (too subjective/dramatic)
- "killer feature" (cringey tech bro speak)
- "brilliantly", "perfectly" (trying too hard)
- "perfect" / "perfectly" (NEVER - nothing is perfect, don't exaggerate or try to live up to this)
- "exceeded expectations" (AI-sounding)
- "breakthrough" (too grandiose)
- "novel" (sounds hype-y; use "interesting", "useful", or "creative" instead)

### Too Aggressive
- "demanded", "insisted", "forced" (use "asked for", "requested", "required" instead)
- "nailed" (too confident; use "did well", "performed well", "worked well", or "got it right" instead)

### Jargon-y or Techie
- "brief" (use "prompt" instead - sounds more natural)
- "administrative" (too jargon-y - use "basic", "conventional", "rectangular shapes", "state outlines" instead)
- "matured" (too formal/hype-y; use "got better", "improved", or "were designed better" instead)
- "shipped" (too techie; use "released", "created", "built", "published", "launched", "made", or "completed" instead)
- "ship" (use "publish", "create", "launch", "build", or "make" instead)
- "gating" (too techie/jargon-y; use "blocking", "limiting", or "restricting" instead)
- "sanitized" (too formal/technical; use "cleaned", "selected", "processed", or another more casual but accurate word for it)
- "digestible" (for data/visualizations; use "understandable", "easy to see", "clear", or "readable" instead)

### Other
- "rock-solid" (use "solid" instead)
- "drove" (use "guided", "led", or "directed" instead)
- "Time Invested" (use "Time" instead - shorter and clearer)
- Multiple exclamation marks (!!)
- Excessive parenthetical asides
- ALL CAPS (be careful - use sparingly, only for emphasis when needed)

## Punctuation Guidelines

- **Don't use em dashes (—)** - use regular dashes (-) or colons (:) instead
- **Don't use multiple exclamation marks** - use single periods
- **Avoid excessive parentheses** - keep asides minimal

## Style Guidelines

1. **Be direct and concise**: Say what happened, not how amazing it was. Cut unnecessary words.
2. **Drop unnecessary verbs**: "Grade B-" not "assigned Grade B-". "tried X" not "attempted to X". "hit Y" not "encountered Y".
3. **Use simpler verbs**: Prefer "tried", "hit", "got", "did", "made" over formal alternatives like "attempted", "encountered", "obtained", "performed", "created".
4. **Use specific details**: "Shows 7,734 earthquakes" beats "amazing data display"
5. **Avoid hyperbole**: If everything is excellent, nothing is
6. **Sound human**: Write like you're telling a colleague, not marketing
7. **One adjective max**: "clean dark theme" not "gorgeous top-tier stunning dark theme"
8. **Never say perfect**: Nothing is perfect. Use "worked well", "accurate", "clean execution" instead. Don't exaggerate or try to live up to perfection.
9. **Avoid grandiose words**: "breakthrough" → "insight", "key finding", "what worked"
10. **Use all caps sparingly**: Only when truly needed for emphasis, not for regular text
11. **Use "prompt" not "brief"**: "rewrote the prompt" not "rewrote the brief"
12. **Avoid em dashes**: Use regular dashes (-) or colons (:) instead of em dashes (—)
13. **Avoid aggressive language**: Use "asked for" or "requested" instead of "demanded" or "insisted". Use "required" instead of "forced" when describing what happened.
14. **Avoid jargon**: Use plain language instead of technical terms. "Administrative boundaries" → "boring rectangular shapes" or "state outlines". Describe what things actually are, not their technical category.
15. **Use numerals instead of written numbers**: Prefer "3", "10", "11" instead of "three", "ten", "eleven" unless there's a specific reason (e.g., proper nouns, beginning of sentences where it reads better, or idiomatic expressions). "3 AI platforms" not "three AI platforms". "11 different outputs" not "eleven different outputs".

## Examples

### Core Pattern: Simpler Verbs, Drop Unnecessary Words

**Before**: "Reviewed initial results, attempted to provide real GeoJSON data, encountered free tier limit, assigned Grade B- based on strong initial progress cut short by free tier limit."
**After**: "Reviewed initial results, tried providing real GeoJSON data, hit free tier limit, Grade B- based on strong initial progress cut short by free tier limit."

### Other Examples

**Before**: "Bolt.new delivered an excellent implementation with gorgeous visuals and killer features!"
**After**: "Bolt.new shows 7,734 earthquakes with detailed stats (max mag 7.6, avg depth 21km). Strong tooltips."

**Before**: "Round 1 was a miss—every model handed me administrative boundaries—so I halted the run, rewrote the brief..."
**After**: "Round 1 was a miss: every model handed me administrative boundaries, so I stopped the run, rewrote the prompt..."

**Before**: "Where I Redirected The Brief"
**After**: "Where I Redirected The Prompt"

**Before**: "Called out the first batch for being too administrative and demanded organic shapes."
**After**: "Called out the first batch for being too administrative and asked for organic shapes."

**Before**: "Rewrote the prompt to insist on organic shapes."
**After**: "Rewrote the prompt to ask for organic shapes."

**Before**: "The concept forced every platform to grapple with real GIS workflows."
**After**: "The concept required every platform to grapple with real GIS workflows."

**Before**: "Round 1 was a miss: every model handed me administrative boundaries."
**After**: "Round 1 was a miss: every model gave me basic shapes like state outlines."

**Before**: "Nailed the 'small dataset, high impact' prompt and pointed straight to the FAA/BTAA sources."
**After**: "Did well with the 'small dataset, high impact' prompt and pointed straight to the FAA/BTAA sources."

## Why This Matters

AI-generated text often sounds overly enthusiastic and unnatural, using the same excited words repeatedly. It also tends to be overly formal, adding unnecessary verbs and words that make it sound like a report instead of a conversation.

This makes documentation less credible and harder to trust. Keep it simple, direct, and conversational. Use varied, specific language that focuses on what actually happened rather than how you felt about it. Let the results speak for themselves.
