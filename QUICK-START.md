# Quick Start Guide - Day 1: Points

Your 30-Day Map Challenge 2025 repository is ready! Let's launch Day 1. 🚀

---

## 🎯 The Workflow (Cursor as Your Assistant)

**Cursor's Role**: Workflow manager, prompt crafter, implementation coordinator
**Web LLMs' Role**: Ideation (Claude.ai, ChatGPT, Gemini)
**Dev Platforms' Role**: Implementation (Bolt.new, V0, etc.)

---

## 🚀 Day 1: Points - Start Here!

### Phase 1: Ideation (10 minutes)

I've prepared 3 prompts for you to use on the web versions of each LLM.

#### Step 1: Copy & Paste These Prompts

**Go to Claude.ai** and paste:

```
Today's #30DayMapChallenge theme is: POINTS

Theme description: Point data (locations, POIs, clusters). Focus on symbolization and density visualization.

Give me 2 map concepts for this theme - one creative/unusual and one straightforward/classic.

For each concept, provide:
1. Title and 2-sentence description
2. Specific data source (must be free/accessible)
3. Estimated implementation difficulty (Easy/Medium/Hard)
4. Why it would work well across multiple AI development platforms
5. Visual appeal for social media sharing

Constraints:
- Must be achievable in ~1 hour
- Should work as web-based interactive map
- Data must be free and readily available
- Will be implemented using platforms like Claude Artifacts, Bolt.new, V0.dev, etc.
- Goal is to test which platforms handle point visualization best

Please be specific about data sources and keep concepts realistic for rapid implementation.
```

**Go to ChatGPT** and paste:

```
I'm doing the #30DayMapChallenge. Today's theme is: POINTS

Description: Point data (locations, POIs, clusters). Focus on symbolization and density.

Give me 2 map concepts:
- 1 creative/unexpected interpretation
- 1 straightforward/classic approach

For each, specify:
1. Clear concept description (2-3 sentences)
2. Exact data source (with URL if possible)
3. Difficulty level and estimated time
4. Why it's good for testing AI development platforms
5. What makes it visually compelling

Requirements:
- Implementable in 1 hour across multiple platforms
- Free, accessible data
- Web-based interactive visualization
- Should work on platforms like Replit, Lovable, ChatGPT Canvas, etc.
- Test case for comparing AI coding tools

Be specific about data access and implementation approach.
```

**Go to Gemini** and paste:

```
#30DayMapChallenge Theme: POINTS

Focus: Point data - locations, POIs, clusters. Emphasize symbolization and density visualization.

Please provide 2 map concepts:
1. One creative/artistic interpretation
2. One practical/straightforward approach

For each concept include:
- Title and description (2-3 sentences)
- Data source (must be free and accessible)
- Implementation complexity (Easy/Medium/Hard)
- Why it tests AI platform capabilities well
- Visual/shareability factor

Context:
- I'll implement this across 8-10 AI development platforms (Claude Artifacts, Bolt.new, V0.dev, Google AI Studio, Replit, etc.)
- Goal is comparative analysis: which platforms handle cartography best
- Need concepts that work in ~1 hour
- Should be web-based, interactive
- Will be shared on social media

Focus on feasible, well-defined concepts with clear data sources.
```

#### Step 2: Review & Choose

You now have **6 concepts** (2 from each LLM).

Pick the BEST one based on:
- ✅ Clear, accessible data source
- ✅ Interesting visual potential
- ✅ Reasonable difficulty for 1 hour
- ✅ Will work across multiple platforms
- ✅ You're excited about it!

---

#### Step 3: Paste Back to Cursor

Come back here and paste your chosen concept. I'll then help you:
1. Craft the perfect implementation prompt
2. Prepare it for all platforms
3. Guide you through the launch

---

## 📋 What to Paste Back

Format:
```
CHOSEN CONCEPT:

Title: [concept title]

Description: [2-3 sentence description]

Data Source: [specific source with URL if available]

Difficulty: [Easy/Medium/Hard]

Source: [Claude/ChatGPT/Gemini]

Why I chose it:
- [reason 1]
- [reason 2]
```

## ⏰ Time Breakdown

```
✅ 0:00-0:05   Repository setup (done!)
📋 0:05-0:15   Get ideation from web LLMs (← YOU ARE HERE)
🔙 0:15-0:20   Paste chosen concept back to Cursor
🛠️  0:20-0:25   Cursor helps craft implementation prompt
🚀 0:25-0:30   Launch across all platforms
🔄 0:30-0:50   Review & iterate
💾 0:50-0:60   Save & document
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Open 3 browser tabs**:
   - Claude.ai
   - ChatGPT (chat.openai.com)
   - Gemini (gemini.google.com)

2. **Paste the prompts** (see above)

3. **Review the 6 concepts** they give you

4. **Pick your favorite** and paste it back here in Cursor

5. **I'll take it from there** and help you prep for implementation!

---

## 💡 Tips for Choosing

**Good signs**:
- Data source is a known, reliable API or dataset
- Concept is specific, not vague
- You can visualize what it should look like
- It sounds fun to you!

**Red flags**:
- "Might be able to use..." (vague data)
- Requires data scraping or complex preprocessing
- Too many moving parts for 1 hour
- Boring to you

**Remember**: You'll be implementing this across 8-10 platforms today, so pick something that:
- Has clear success criteria
- Will look good in screenshots
- You'd be proud to share

---

## 🆘 If You're Stuck

**Can't access the web LLMs?**
- Let me know and I can adjust the workflow

**Getting too complex ideas?**
- Ask them to simplify
- Emphasize "1 hour implementation"
- Request "with embedded sample data"

**All ideas seem meh?**
- Ask for 2 more from your favorite LLM
- Or try a second round with different phrasing

---

## 🎉 Ready?

You're all set! The prompts are ready above.

**Your mission**:
1. Copy/paste to Claude.ai, ChatGPT, and Gemini
2. Pick the best concept
3. Come back and paste it here
4. Let's build!

**Go for it!** 🚀🗺️
