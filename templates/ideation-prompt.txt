UNIFIED IDEATION PROMPT TEMPLATE
=================================

Today's #30DayMapChallenge theme is: [THEME NAME]

Theme description: [PASTE DESCRIPTION FROM THEMES.MD]

Please give me 5 map concepts for this theme:
- 3 creative/unusual approaches
- 2 straightforward/classic approaches

For each concept, include:
1. What the map shows (1-2 sentences)
2. Data source needed
3. Difficulty level (Easy/Medium/Hard)
4. Estimated implementation time
5. One unique aspect that makes it interesting

Consider:
- What can be realistically built in ~1 hour across multiple AI platforms
- Visual appeal and shareability
- Data availability (prefer free, accessible sources)
- Technical feasibility for web-based visualization
- Creativity within constraints
- Should work well as web-based interactive map
- Can be implemented by AI coding platforms

Format your response as a numbered list for easy scanning.
